- 👋 Hi, It's @Adelaiye-OgalaLab Github account
- 👀 Our research group engages in basic and translational research in genitourinary cancers, emphasizing the molecular regulation of signaling pathways in prostate and kidney cancers.
- 🌱 We are currently investigating...
- (i) Targeting drivers of androgen receptor (AR) cistrome reprogramming associated with advanced aggressive prostate cancer.
- (ii) Investigating post-translational modulations and dynamics of pro-oncogenic glucocorticoid receptor activity as a compensatory hormone nuclear receptor in prostate cancers.
- (iii) Developing and characterizing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid models of prostate cancers, specifically from underrepresented populations.
- 💞️ We're happy to collaborate with other research ideas and group. 
- 📫 Please feel free to reach out our website https://adelaiye-ogala-laboratory.com/
